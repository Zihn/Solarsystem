These scripts are imported from another project.. 'Shapes'

In the 'Shapes' project I tested some overlap techniques. Where I wanted to be able to detect the overlapping vertices and form a new shape from those vertices. This is still an ongoing project.

I was to lazy to clean these classes to strip the overlap code. So there is a lot of extra stuff in the shape classes doing nothing at the moment.
